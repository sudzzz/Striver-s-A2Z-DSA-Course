/*
HCF of 2 numbers
Eucledian Algorithm --> gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) ; for a>b

It can be modified to gcd(a,b) = gcd(a%b,b); for a>be

e.g gcd(52,10) = gcd(42,10) = gcd(32,10) = gcd(22,10) = gcd(12,10) = gcd(2,10); for appltying gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b); a>b
is equivalent to gcd(2,10) with gcd(52,10) = gcd(52%10,10) = gcd(2,10)
gcd(10,2) = gcd(10%2,2) = gcd(0,2). Therefore gcd  = 2

Always apply greater%smaller till one of them is 0. If one of them gets 0, the other one is the gcd.

Time complexity = O(log(min(a,b))base Î¦)

Whenever there is divisions happening, the number of iterations will be in terms of log. Over here there is
modulo where we are reducing the number by division
