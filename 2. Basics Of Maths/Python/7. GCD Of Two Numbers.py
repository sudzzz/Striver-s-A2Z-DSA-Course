#HCF of 2 numbers
#Eucledian Algorithm --> gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) ; for a>b
#
#It can be modified to gcd(a,b) = gcd(a%b,b); for a>b
#
#e.g gcd(52,10) = gcd(42,10) = gcd(32,10) = gcd(22,10) = gcd(12,10) = gcd(2,10); for appltying gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b); a>b
#is equivalent to gcd(2,10) with gcd(52,10) = gcd(52%10,10) = gcd(2,10)
#gcd(10,2) = gcd(10%2,2) = gcd(0,2). Therefore gcd  = 2
#
#Always apply greater%smaller till one of them is 0. If one of them gets 0, the other one is the gcd.
#
#Time complexity = O(log(min(a,b))base Î¦)
#
#Whenever there is divisions happening, the number of iterations will be in terms of log. Over here there is
#modulo where we are reducing the number by division
